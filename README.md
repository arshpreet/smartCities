# smartCities
Final year Computer Engg. undergraduate project on Enhancing Data Analytics in Smart City Infrastructure
Working with Surat Municipality Corporation (SMC), we proposed a centralized 4 layers architecture for an easy and fast flow of 
information in the smart city. These layers include data collection from sources, information to the departments, middleware and data
analytics layer. We are using ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) for visualization and Python and Matlab for analytics and 
learning. 
In this repository we have the MatlabCode.
Major use-cases that we are trying to solve are waste management, monitoring gender equality, water supply management and 
revenue collection.
The relevant data and outcomes for each of the use-cases is in their respective folders by name.
